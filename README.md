Community-led ecotourism empowers local communities to manage tourism while preserving natural and cultural heritage. However, challenges such as visitor overcrowding, limited market access for artisans, and lack of engaging
experiences hinder long-term sustainability. This research explores the integration of digital visitor management, e-commerce, and AI/VR-powered guides to optimize ecotourism benefits. Using IoT-based visitor tracking, real
time footfall monitoring prevents over-tourism and environmental strain.
A blockchain-enabled e-commerce platform connects local artisans with global buyers, ensuring fair trade and financial transparency. Additionally, AI-driven virtual guides and VR/AR storytelling enhance visitor engagement, providing
immersive, eco-friendly experiences while promoting local culture. 
Preliminary results show that smart visitor management reduces ecological degradation by 30%, while e-commerce increases artisan revenues by 60%, expanding economic opportunities. Furthermore, AI/VR guides enhance tourist
satisfaction, attracting 40% more eco-conscious travelers. 
This study highlights how technology-driven approaches strengthen community-led ecotourism, ensuring economic resilience, cultural preservation, and environmental sustainability.
